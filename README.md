# Danny's Diner Case Study #1

8 week SQL challenege is a challenge started by Danny Ma. He has a website called "8weelsqlchallenge.com". On this website you can find the related case studies for your SQL practice and have a deep understanding of SQL by solving questions based on real life problems.

This is my solution for case study number 1 called Danny's Diner.


# Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

● sales               
● menu       
● members
